Our poverty prediction and mapping system will use this data to create a poverty index
that can be used to predict poverty levels in specific regions and communities. This
index will take into account various factors, such as income levels, access to education
and healthcare, and the availability of basic amenities like clean water and sanitation.
By analyzing this data, our AI system will be able to identify areas that are most at risk
of poverty, and provide policymakers with the information they need to make informed
decisions about how to allocate resources and implement programs to reduce poverty.
